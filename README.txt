This application will take the information in the Duke Internal Medicine Survival Guide and make it usable as a mobile app. The information includes articles about conditions and diseases written by Duke medical staff, for Duke medical staff, as well as important phone numbers.

As universal usability is the goal of this application, we will develop both an iOS version and an Android version of the application. Within both native apps, there will be a web app for the entry of future information. Whereas web applications may be slower than native applications, it is the most feasible option in implementing what the client wants. 

All dependencies for the iOS app are contained in this project bundle.

This app will be deployed using the Duke Enterprise license.
